# Introduction
Welcome to my Colorado climbing route dashboard project. In this case study, I analyze route climbing data to answer key business questions around routes and the climbers trends around these routes.

To do this, I developed a Python pipeline for data collection, made SQL queries of the data and visualized in Python. The goal was to turn raw, data into actionable insights that drive better decision-making for Colorado climbers.

# Background
In order to make informed climbing decisions, I show how climbing data can be transformed into actionable insights for climbers.

This project was inspired by my passion for the local climbing community in Colorado and specifically in the Boulder area where I live. 

# Tools I used
- **SQL**: For querying the data for the final data analysis. 
- **Python**: For data pipeline, data cleaning, EDA and visualization. 
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Editing GitHub-facing files such as `README.md` and license documentation.  
- **GitHub and Git**: Version control and sharing of analysis, visualizations, and code.
- **Markup**: For the `README.md` file and for the live Leaderboards website.
- **ChatGPT**: Assisted with routine tasks and project efficiency.

# How I Built It
I began by aquiring via webscraper Python script and then cleaning the datasource. Then in did an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python.
I ran queries during final data analysis in PostgreSQL and visualized in Python.
Finally, I built interactive **Route Metrics** and real time **Leaderboards** on top of this clean dataset to uncover trends in the climibing community. The leaderboards feed updates periodically.
