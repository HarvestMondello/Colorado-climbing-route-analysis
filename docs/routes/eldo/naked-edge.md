## Route Characteristics  
- Striking arete and dihedral route is visible across Eldorado Canyon from the main road and from The Bastille formation.  
- Sustained climbing with multiple cruxes: fingerlocks, stemming, technical face sequences, and crack climbing.  
- Known for **serious exposure**: the upper pitches perch dramatically above the canyon.  
- Protection is generally good, with some runouts to PG-13, but the commitment and pump factor add to its bold reputation.
