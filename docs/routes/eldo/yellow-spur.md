## Summary  
*The Yellow Spur* is considered one of the most iconic multipitch climbs in Eldorado Canyon. This striking moderate testpiece has exposure, continuous difficulties, and historic significance. It stands as both a **cultural landmark** and a **high-traffic classic**.  

The climb features a mix of technical roof and corner climbing, delicate face sequences, and airy exposure. Today it remains both a rite of passage for aspiring Eldo leaders and a beloved repeat classic for locals.

## Route Characteristics  
- Striking upper yellow face and dihedral visible across the canyon.  
- Starts in corners, then delicate face climbing, before breaking into an **iconic yellow lichen arete**.  
- Technical cruxes: pumpy roofs, thin face moves, traverses, and an exposed arete finish.  
- Upper pitches provide **wild exposure** high above the canyon.  
- Good protection at cruxes (PG), but easier sections are runout (PG-13).  
- Optional direct starts/finishes add difficulty and spice (5.10B).  

### Approach & Descent 
- The approach is steep uphill (2nd class) and considerd a long approach by Eldo standards taking 20 minutes for the average climber. 
- The East Slab descent (4th class) is standard walk-off and is technical involving some routefinding. Two other descents are used.  

### Seasonal Profile & Sun Aspect  
- **Seasonality:** Climbed year-round; peak fall season; low winter traffic.  
- **Sun Exposure:** West-facing. Summer shade; spring morning shade + fall afternoon sun; cold winters but with usable afternoon sun.  


## Historical Context  
- **1959:** First ascent by Layton Kor & Dave Dornan (Direct Start + Finish, 5.10B).  
- **1964:** First free ascent by Royal Robbins & Pat Ament via 5.9+ variation (Ament Start + Robbins Traverse Finish).  
- Rapidly became one of the **most climbed Eldorado classics** and a generational milestone.  
- Known as a proving ground for climbers seeking to establish themselves on Eldo moderates.  
- Notable for repeat ascents by prolific locals, including Bill Wright (100–200+) and Danny Gilbert (250+).
