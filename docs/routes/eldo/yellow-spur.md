## Summary  
*The Yellow Spur* is considered one of the most iconic multipitch climbs in Eldorado Canyon. This striking moderate testpiece has striking exposure, continuous difficulties and historic significance. In this analysis, the route stands out as both a **cultural landmark** and a **high-traffic classic**. Featuring a brilliant mix of technical roof and corner climbing, delicate face sequences and airy exposure, it epitomizes the adventurous spirit of climbing in the canyon. Today it remains both a rite of passage for aspiring Eldo leaders and a beloved repeat classic for locals.  

## Route Characteristics  
- Striking upper yellow face and dihedral route is visible across Eldorado Canyon from the main road and from The West Ridge formation.  
- Starts in a series of corner systems, then delicate face climbing before breaking into a **iconic yellow lichen covered arete** that defines the route.  
- Technical cruxes include pumpy roofs, technical corners, thin face moves and airy traverses and finishes on an exposed arete.  
- Upper pitches provide **wild exposure** with jaw-dropping positions above the canyon.  
- Good protection at cruxes (PG), but easier sections are runout (PG-13).  
- Optional direct starts and direct finishes adds difficulty and spice to 5.10B.
