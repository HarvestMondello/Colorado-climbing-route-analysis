## Summary  
*The Yellow Spur* is considered one of the most iconic multipitch climbs in Eldorado Canyon. This striking moderate testpiece has exposure, continuous difficulties, and historic significance. It stands as both a **cultural landmark** and a **high-traffic classic**.  

The climb features a mix of technical roof and corner climbing, delicate face sequences, and airy exposure. Today it remains both a rite of passage for aspiring Eldo leaders and a beloved repeat classic for locals.

## Route Characteristics  
- Striking upper yellow face and dihedral visible across the canyon.  
- Starts in corners, then delicate face climbing, before breaking into an **iconic yellow lichen arete**.  
- Technical cruxes: pumpy roofs, thin face moves, traverses, and an exposed arete finish.  
- Upper pitches provide **wild exposure** high above the canyon.  
- Good protection at cruxes (PG), but easier sections are runout (PG-13).  
- Optional direct starts/finishes add difficulty and spice (5.10B).

- Notable for repeat ascents by prolific locals, including Bill Wright (100‚Äì200+) and Danny Gilbert (250+).
