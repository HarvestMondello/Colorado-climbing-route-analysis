<img src="https://github.com/HarvestMondello/Colorado-climbing-route-analysis/blob/main/assets/naked-edge.png" alt="The Naked Edge on the Redgarde Wall: Tower Two in Eldorado Canyon" width="1200"/>

- **Area:** Eldorado Canyon, Colorado  
- **Formation:** Redgarden: Tower Two  
- **Grade:** 5.11b (6 pitches) 
- **Length:** 460' 
- **Style:** Trad, multipitch  
- **First Ascent:** Layton Kor & Rick Horn, 1964 (lower 3 pitches: Kor & Bob Culp, 1962)  
- **First Free Ascent:** Jim Erickson & Duncan Ferguson, 1971  

## Summary  
*The Naked Edge* is considered the crown jewel of Eldorado Canyon and one of the most iconic multipitch climbs in North America. With striking exposure, continuous difficulty, and historic significance, it remains a must-do for generations of climbers. In this analysis, the route stands out as both a **cultural landmark** and a **high-traffic classic**.  

## Route Characteristics  
- Striking arete and dihedral route is visible across Eldorado Canyon from the main road and from The Bastille formation.  
- Sustained climbing with multiple cruxes: fingerlocks, stemming, technical face sequences, and crack climbing.  
- Known for **serious exposure**: the upper pitches perch dramatically above the canyon.  
- Protection is generally good, with some runouts to PG-13, but the commitment and pump factor add to its bold reputation.

## Historical Context  
- **1964:** First ascent by Layton Kor & Rick Horn (upper pitches); lower pitches by Kor & Bob Culp, 1962 (aid).  
- **1971:** First free ascent by Jim Erickson & Duncan Ferguson, establishing it as one of the hardest free climbs in the U.S. at the time.  
- Quickly gained a reputation as the **testpiece of Eldorado** and a benchmark for bold free climbing in the 1970s‚Äì80s.  

### Fastest Known Time (FKT) 
- These FKT's are up to date as of as of **9/15/2025**
- The rules: Bridge-to-Bridge (the center of the South Boulder Peak footbridge) , any style of roped climbing. All konwn FKT's on this route involve soloing the approach (YDS 5.8), simul climb the route using Micro Traxion or comparable devices to protect the second and take the East Slab (4th class) descent. 
- **Stefan Griebel** & **Joe Kennedy** have the current FKT at "22 minutes 44 seconds B2B" set October 26th, 2022.
