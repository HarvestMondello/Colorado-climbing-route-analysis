# Scripts

This directory contains all Python scripts used in the **Colorado Climbing Route Analysis** project.  
They are organized by purpose into four subfolders:

## ðŸ“‚ Subfolders

- **[`scraping/`](./scraping/)**  
  Scripts for web scraping data from Mountain Project (routes, ticks, metadata).  
  Typical flow: scrape regions â†’ scrape routes â†’ scrape ticks â†’ clean & join outputs.  

- **[`analysis/`](./analysis/)**  
  Exploratory data analysis, modeling, and forecasting.  
  Includes scripts for seasonality, clustering, forecasting, and daily usage patterns.  

- **[`leaderboards/`](./leaderboards/)**  
  Builds Markdown leaderboards and per-route profile pages for publication under `docs/`.  
  Automates the conversion of analysis outputs into GitHub-ready documentation.  

- **[`automation/`](./automation/)**  
  Runner scripts that glue the whole pipeline together.  
  Used for local refreshes or scheduled jobs (cron, GitHub Actions).  

## ðŸ”„ Typical Workflow
1. **Scraping** â†’ Collect raw route/tick data.  
2. **Analysis** â†’ Perform EDA, seasonality, forecasting, and route-level insights.  
3. **Leaderboards** â†’ Generate Markdown docs from processed data.  
4. **Automation** â†’ Run everything end-to-end (manual or scheduled).
